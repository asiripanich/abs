# abs

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of abs is to provide a function to read csv tables downloaded from ABS TableBuilder without having to 'tidy' them first. Thus, this helps ti retain the meta information of the tables.

## Installation

You can install the development version of abs from GitHub with:

``` r
remotes::install_githib("asiripanich/abs")
```

## Example

```{r example}
library(abs)
data_dir <- system.file("extdata", package = "abs")
test_csv <- file.path(data_dir, "tb1.csv")
mytable <- abs_read_tb(test_csv, exclude_total = TRUE)
mytable
```
