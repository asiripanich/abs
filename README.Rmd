The goal of abs is to provide a function to read csv tables downloaded from ABS TableBuilder without having to 'tidy' them first. Thus, this helps ti retain the meta information of the tables.

## Table Builder

Currently, The package only works with Table Builder files downloaded as "CSV String Value (.csv)", as shown in the image below.

## Installation

You can install the development version of abs from GitHub with:

``` r
remotes::install_githib("asiripanich/abs")
```

## Example

The main function is `abs_read_tb()` which let you read in a TableBuilder file downloaded as "CSV String Value (.csv)" into a tidy data by ignoring all its metadata.

```{r example}
library(abs)
data_dir <- system.file("extdata", package = "abs")
test_csv <- file.path(data_dir, "tb1.csv")
mytable <- abs_read_tb(test_csv, .names = "simplify", exclude_total = TRUE)
mytable
```

Note that `abs_read_tb` returns a data.table object. To convert it back to data.frame simply use `as.data.frame()`.
